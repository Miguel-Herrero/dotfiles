# Dotfiles

This setup assumes you are using OSX.

To install it, just clone this repository to your home directory in a .dotfiles directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/sadir/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Next install [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) but don't echo the lines into your `~/.bash_profile`.

Finally run the `create_symlinks.sh` file, and you're done!
